#### 1. 

An orthonormal basis along (3,4,0) vector would be (3/5, 4/5, 0) by normalization. 

The second one along with a principal axis would be (-4/5, 3/5, 0). (Other options exists, as long as it is normalized and its dot product is 0 along with vector u).

The last one results in as a cross product of first and second vectors. As, u and v vectors are in the same x,y plane, the cross product of xy plane is (0,0,1).
$$
u = \begin{pmatrix} 
\frac{3}{5} \\\\
\frac{4}{5} \\\\
0    
\end{pmatrix}\ 
v = \begin{pmatrix} 
-\frac{4}{5} \\\\
\frac{3}{5} \\\\
0    
\end{pmatrix}
n =
\begin{pmatrix} 
0 \\\\
0 \\\\
1  
\end{pmatrix}
$$

#### 2. (1,10) 
For what I have understood, I just found the intersection of the two vectors p0 and p1, and interpolated the two vectors which cross (4,0).
